Description
--------
Thought we'd try our hand at making a HTML5 game again using the Phaser HTML5 sdk. The game is a little wave fighter where you kill many incoming waves of mobs and attempt to get as high a score as possible before you die. 

HTML5 Game called the Golden Helm

Use Arrow Keys to move 
One and two to attack
Kill all the mobs

About 20 hours of development time
